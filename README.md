## A paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article
This article is interesting that it explains the way that the growing complexity of software systems could kill developers. It provides some insights about the current and future software development environment.

## Comment from me (javajavscript)
The article claims that it has never been more difficult to be a software developer than it is today due to explosion of choice and fast pace of development

## Ruochen:
This is also my feeling as I'm learning software engineering. There are always unheard technologies and it's hard to catch on.

## Shrey:

I can completely relate to this. I feel like when our parent's generation was entering the tech-scape, that it was much easier to keep up with new technologies, because there would be a few major developements each year that could be easily kept up with. Now, though, it is much harder since there are advancements across many industries and sectors that it feels easy to just get lost in it all.
